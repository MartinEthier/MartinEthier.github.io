My 3rd undergraduate internship was spent at the Communications Research Centre (CRC), which is a Government of Canada research lab focused on wireless communications. During this term, I worked with spatial cellular signal strength datasets. I trained random forests and fully-connected neural networks using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn to perform spatial interpolation of the signal strengths, improving upon the baseline methods. I reduced error by 5% and smoothed the output maps by constructing rotational features in the dataset. I then created cellular signal strength data visualization tools with wxPython and the Google Maps Static API. This internship was my first exposure to machine learning, and provided me with useful insights on the importance of feature engineering.
