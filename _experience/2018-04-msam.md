My 2nd undergraduate internship was spent at the Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab. This is a research lab at the University of Waterloo that specialises in additive manufacturing, specifically additive manufacturing of metal parts. I worked with powder bed fusion (PBF) machines to 3D print metal parts and then acquired 3D scans of those parts using a CT scanner. I then wrote MATLAB code using the Image Processing Toolbox to process these 3D scans with the goal of analyzing the pore structure of these printed parts. This was my first exposure to the world of image processing, which led me down the long road of discovering computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.
