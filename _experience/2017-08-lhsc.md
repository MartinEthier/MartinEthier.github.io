excerpt: "My 1st undergraduate internship was spent at the London Regional Cancer Program (LCRP) at the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC). During this term, I spent time calibrating and operating electron beam radiation therapy machines. Some of my time was spent irradiating radio-chromic gels using these machines and then analyzing images of these gels using MATLAB to get dosage measurements. I spent the rest of my time writing Python scripts to automate and streamline the creation of radiation treatment plans in the cancer centre's treatment planning software. I also utilized Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and XAML to create and integrate custom GUIs into the Python scripts. This was my first exposure to writing software outside of course material, and I learned a lot about creating GUIs and working with new APIs."
