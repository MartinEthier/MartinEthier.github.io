I completed my final internship during the summer before starting grad school, and it was spent at OTTO Motors, a division of Clearpath Robotics (now owned by Rockwell Automation). OTTO Motors builds autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for material handling in warehouses. Think of a pallet that can drive itself around warehouses to transport goods. I worked on the perception team, who's job is to process the sensor inputs to estimate the robot's current position as well as the state of its environment. 


\item Developed a simulation in Unity to generate perception data using domain randomization
    \item Trained YOLOv7 models to perform forklift detection
