My 3rd undergraduate internship was spent at P&P Optica, a company in Waterloo that builds hyperspectral imaging systems to automatically detect contaminants in food. Hyperspectral imaging systems are able to take images with a continuous wavelength dimension. This means that for each pixel, we are able to determine the material by classifying the spectral signature using machine learning. 

% \item Developed Python code to perform real-time processing of hyperspectral image data using OpenCV
\item Trained SVMs and CNNs to classify freshness in vegetables from hyperspectral image data using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
\item Created hyperspectral data clustering visualization tools with PCA, k-means, and DBSCAN using Scikit-Learn
\item Reduced data labeling time by 40\% by creating an automatic ROI masking tool using spectral filtering and OpenCV
