title: "WATonomous"
excerpt: "I spent about 2.5 years in the perception division for WATonomous, a student team participating in the SAE AutoDrive Challenge. I spent time training models on custom datasets to do 3D dynamic object detection, lane detection, and 2D sign detection. I then pivoted to working on a research project, where we looked into sim2real domain adaptation for lane detection. This work resulted in a publication at IV2022. More information on the paper can be found in the Publications page.<br/><img src='/images/projects/wato_car.png' style='width:512px;'>"
