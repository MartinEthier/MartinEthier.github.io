title: "Comma Calibration Challenge"
excerpt: "This is a recruitment challenge given by comma.ai where the goal is to estimate the offset between the camera pose and ego heading. This is a very small dataset, so machine learning solutions are not likely to generalize well. In the end, my solution utilized visual odometry based on feature tracking. I also trained a semantic segmentation model on the comma10k dataset and used it to improve the odometry pipeline performance by about 5%. Since this is a recruiting challenge, I've been asked by comma.ai to keep the solution code private, but the segmentation model training code can be found <a href="https://github.com/MartinEthier/comma10k-segnet">here</a>.<br/><img src='/images/projects/visual_odometry.png' style='width:512px;'>"
