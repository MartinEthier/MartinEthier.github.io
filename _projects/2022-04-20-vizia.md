title: "Vizia (FYDP)"
excerpt: "For my Fourth Year Design Project (FYDP), my team and I built a smart glasses device for the visually impaired. I spent most of my time building computer vision features to allow users to accomplish tasks using the camera on the device. The computer vision features included are OCR, color detection, and money classification. For OCR, I utilized the Google Cloud Vision API to return any text in the image. For color detection, I developed an algorithm that returns the nearest color in a database. For money classification, I collected a custom image dataset of different bills and trained a ResNet using PyTorch to classify the bills. We were awarded an Interdisciplinary Capstone Design Award for this project.<br/><img src='/images/projects/vizia_pipeline.png' style='width:512px;'>"
