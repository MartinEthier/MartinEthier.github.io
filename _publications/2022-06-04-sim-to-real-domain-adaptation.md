title: "Sim-to-Real Domain Adaptation for Lane Detection and Classification in Autonomous Driving"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore the use of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) to improve the sim2real performance of lane detection and classification methods in the context of autonomous vehicles. We construct a labelled simulation dataset using the CARLA simulator and evaluate our methods on the TuSimple dataset, without using any labels from TuSimple during training. We propose the use of both adversarial discriminative and adversarial generative methods and show how they can be used to improve the baseline performance of the Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection (UFLD) method.'
