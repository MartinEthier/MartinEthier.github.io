Throughout my master's, I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for various undergraduate courses. For all these courses, I have prepared and conducted tutorials, helped students with lab assignments, developed and updated assignments, as well as marked assignments and exams. The courses I have TA'ed are as follows:
