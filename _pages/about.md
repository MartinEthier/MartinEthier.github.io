## Overview

I am machine learning engineer with an interest in artificial intelligence for robotics. I am currently working on my master's degree at the University of Waterloo, where I am researching neural rendering for autonomous vehicle simulation. See the Publications and Research pages for more information on my research. During my undergrad, I have worked multiple internships as a machine learning engineer at companies such as OTTO Motors, DarwinAI, and Huawei. I worked on many software projects during my undergrad, including student design teams, three hackathons, a capstone design project, and many personal projects. See the Projects page for more information on these projects.

## Philosophy on Self-Driving Cars

After discovering the world of computer vision and machine learning, I naturally gravitated towards robotics. I eventually discovered the self-driving car problem, and have been obsessed with it ever since. Over the years, as deep learning techniques improved, I developed the opinion that the future of self-driving is large end-to-end deep learning models, as opposed to the existing modular paradigm. This change in my belief was helped quite a bit by people like George Hotz (comma.ai) and Alex Kendall (wayve.ai). With the advent of LLMs, this further reinforced my beliefs that scaling end-to-end deep learning models is our best chance at solving the self-driving car problem. If you haven't already, you should go read [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). This lesson has been true for computer vision, game playing, natural language processing, and many more fields, and I see no reason to believe it doesn't apply to robotics as well.
