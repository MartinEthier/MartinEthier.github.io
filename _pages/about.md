I am machine learning research engineer with an interest in artificial intelligence for robotics. I am currently working on my master's degree at the University of Waterloo, where I am researching neural rendering for autonomous vehicle simulation. During my undergrad, I did multiple internships as a machine learning engineer/researcher at companies such as OTTO Motors, DarwinAI, and Huawei. I worked on many software projects during my undergrad, including student design teams, three hackathons, a capstone design project, and multiple personal projects.

I am currently searching for a full-time position as a research engineer in the fields of computer vision, robotics, or self-driving cars. For anyone interested, my resume can be found in the CV section of this website.

<!-- ## Philosophy on Self-Driving Cars

After discovering the world of computer vision and machine learning, I naturally gravitated towards robotics. I eventually stumbled upon the self-driving car problem and have been obsessed with it ever since. Over the years, as deep learning techniques have improved, I developed the opinion that the future of self-driving cars is large end-to-end deep learning models, as opposed to the existing modular paradigm. This change in my belief was helped quite a bit by people like George Hotz (comma.ai) and Alex Kendall (wayve.ai). With the advent of LLMs, this further reinforced my beliefs that scaling end-to-end deep learning models is our best chance at solving the self-driving car problem. If you haven't already, you should go read [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). This lesson has been true for computer vision, game playing, natural language processing, and many more fields, and I see no reason to believe it doesn't apply to robotics as well. -->
