### Background Overview

I am machine learning engineer with an interest in artificial intelligence for robotics. I am currently working on my master's degree at the University of Waterloo, where I am researching neural rendering for autonomous vehicle simulation. See the Publications and Research pages for more information on my research. During my undergrad, I have worked multiple internships as a machine learning engineer at companies such as OTTO Motors, DarwinAI, and Huawei. I worked on many software projects during my undergrad, including student design teams, three hackathons, a capstone design project, and many personal projects. See the Projects page for more information on these projects.

### Philosophy on Self-Driving Cars

After discovering the world of computer vision and machine learning, I naturally gravitated towards robotics. I eventually discovered the self-driving car problem, and have been obsessed with it ever since. Over the years, as deep learning techniques improved, I developed the opinion that the future of self-driving is large end-to-end deep learning models, as opposed to the existing modular paradigm. This change in my belief was helped quite a bit by people like George Hotz (comma.ai) and Alex Kendall (wayve.ai). With the advent of LLMs, this further reinforced my beliefs that scaling end-to-end deep learning models is our best chance at solving the self-driving car problem. If you haven't already, you should go read [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html). It was true for computer vision, it was true for natural language processing, why would it be any different for robotics?

Note that end-to-end deep learning does not necessarily mean a model making decisions with a single forward pass. I believe planning is required to make safe decisions during complex scenarios, as well as reduce the amount of scaling required to achieve some level of performance. For more insight on the effect of test-time planning on scaling laws, see [Scaling Scaling Laws with Board Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03113) from Andy Jones.
