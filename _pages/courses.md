Throughout my master's, I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for various undergraduate courses. For all these courses, I have prepared and conducted tutorials, helped students with lab assignments, developed and updated assignments, as well as marked assignments and exams. The courses I have TA'ed are as follows:

| Course ID | Course Name | Terms Taught |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ECE 495 | Autonomous Vehicles | Winter 2023, Winter 2024 |
| ECE 457C | Reinforcement Learning | Spring 2023, Spring 2024 |
| ECE 250 | Data Structures and Algorithms | Fall 2023 |
